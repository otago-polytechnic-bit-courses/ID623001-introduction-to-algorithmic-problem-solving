# 01: Game mechanics Advanced Assessment Tasks

## Extra features

Implement this advanced functionality. These tasks are self-directed and will require some independent research and problem-solving.

- Implement **Enemy 2** - there is a sprite for a second enemy in the game assets - implement this enemy with increased stats (health, movement speed, etc) and add it to the later waves.
- Your final Waves (last 2 or 3) should feature **a mix** of the 2 Enemy types - you will need to adjust your **SpawnEnemy** script to accept 2 enemy prefabs, and adjust your code to spawn differnt amounts of both.
- You could achieve this by duplicating all the relevant variables for the second enemy, but you should implement this in as robust (and elegant) way as possible, in case in the future you want to add more enemy types (Hint: use Lists)
